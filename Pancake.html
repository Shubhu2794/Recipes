    <h3>Instructions and Steps of how to make::</h3>
    <ol start="1">
      <h4>Mixing Dry Ingredients</h4>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl first take whole wheat flour. If the wheat flour is
        ground in a mill, then do sift the flour once or twice before using.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add salt. Skip adding salt if using salted butter. Add sugar. You can
        even add 1 to 2 teaspoons sugar or skip it entirely.
      </li>
      <li>Add baking powder and ground cinnamon.</li>
      <li>
        With a wired whisk mix all the dry ingredients very well. Set aside.
      </li>
      <h4>Mixing Wet Ingredients</h4>
      <li>
        Take 1.5 cups milk in a saucepan. Keep the pan on a low to medium-low
        flame and begin to heat milk. You can also use almond milk or soy milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the milk is becoming hot do stir occasionally. Do not boil the milk
        but let it only become hot. You should see some steam coming from the
        milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the milk becomes hot, add 1 tablespoon unsalted butter. You can
        also use oil instead of butter. Use a neutral flavored oil.
      </li>
      <li>Mix the butter in the hot milk very well.</li>
      <h4>Making Eggless Pancake Batter</h4>
      <li>
        Then add this mixture to the dry ingredients in the bowl. With a wired
        whisk mix very well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Break lumps with whisk and make a smooth batter. A few tiny lumps are
        alright in the batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        The pancake batter is of a pourable consistency and not thick. If the
        batter looks thick, then you can add <br />
        1/4 to 1/3 cup more of hot milk. Depending on quality and texture of
        whole wheat flour more milk can be added.
      </li>
      <li>Set the pancake batter aside.</li>
      <h4>Making Whole Wheat Pancakes</h4>
      <li>
        Then heat a well seasoned heavy skillet or frying pan. Spread 1/2 to 1
        teaspoon softened unsalted butter or oil on the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        With a ladle gently pour the batter. Do not spread the batter with the
        ladle. The batter spreads on its own. You can even use a 1/4 to 1/3
        measuring cup to pour the pancake batter.
      </li>
      <li>On a medium-low heat cook the pancake.</li>
      <li>
        Cook it till you see bubbles forming on the surface of the egg free
        pancake.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the base looks crispy and golden, gently turn over the whole wheat
        pancake.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the second side also till golden. Then remove eggless pancake and
        serve.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can even stack these eggless pancakes in a casserole or roti basket
        and then serve warm. Make remaining pancakes in batches this way.
      </li>
      <li>
        To speed up the cooking of pancakes, you can opt to use a large frying
        pan or use two skillets or frying pans.
      </li>
